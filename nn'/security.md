## 4.3.2 Recommend Security Controls

Based on the risk assessment, the data asset with the highest risk is **Customer Data**. Here are three recommended security controls to reduce the risk:

### 1. Encryption

- **How it Reduces Risk**: Encrypting customer data ensures that even if unauthorized access occurs, the data remains unreadable without the decryption key.
- **Implementation**: Use AES-256 encryption for all customer data stored on servers and during transmission. Implement encryption at the database level and for all backups.
- **Network Design Impact**: Encryption will be implemented on the servers and databases where customer data is stored. Network traffic containing customer data will also be encrypted using TLS.
- **Disadvantages**: Encryption can introduce performance overhead and may require additional processing power, potentially slowing down data access and transmission.
- **Cost**: 
  - AES-256 Encryption Software: AUD $500 (one-time)
  - TLS Certificates: AUD $100/year

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **How it Reduces Risk**: MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to access customer data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Implementation**: Implement MFA for all user accounts that have access to customer data, including employees and administrators. Use a combination of passwords and one-time codes sent via SMS or generated by an authenticator app.
- **Network Design Impact**: MFA will be integrated into the authentication systems for accessing customer data, including VPN access and application logins.
- **Disadvantages**: MFA can be inconvenient for users, requiring them to perform additional steps during login. It may also require additional support and training for users.
- **Cost**: 
  - MFA Software: AUD $200/user/year
  - SMS Gateway Service: AUD $0.05/SMS

### 3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)

- **How it Reduces Risk**: An IDPS monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and can block potential threats in real-time, helping to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.
- **Implementation**: Deploy an IDPS at the network perimeter and within the internal network to monitor traffic to and from servers storing customer data. Configure the IDPS to alert administrators of any suspicious activity and automatically block known threats.
- **Network Design Impact**: The IDPS will be integrated into the network infrastructure, with sensors placed at strategic points to monitor traffic. This may require additional network configuration and management.
- **Disadvantages**: An IDPS can generate false positives, leading to unnecessary alerts and potential disruptions. It also requires ongoing management and tuning to remain effective.
- **Cost**: 
  - IDPS Hardware: AUD $5,000
  - IDPS Software License: AUD $1,000/year
  - Ongoing Management: AUD $500/month

These controls will help mitigate the risks associated with customer data and enhance the overall security posture of the network.
