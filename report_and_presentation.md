## 5 Report and Presentation

### 5.1 Written Report
The report must be in Markdown on your group project repository. A template and repository will be 
provided to you when you register for the project (see Moodle for link/information). There will be template
Markdown files to use, however images and other supporting files (e.g., spreadsheets, diagrams) must also 
be included in your repository and linked from the relevant Markdown files.

### 5.2 Recorded Presentation
The presentation will be a recorded video that must cover the following:
1. Explain briefly the key ethical issues that the organisation must consider, with each student 
explaining one issue. (Section 4.4)
2. A summary of who contributed to the different tasks during the project, and how many Git 
commits each student made. (Section 4.5)
3. A summary of how your group worked together, e.g., how often you met, where did you meet (inclass, after class, online), what communication mechanisms you used. (Section 4.5)
4. Reflection on what went wrong and how you can improve in the future. (Section 4.5)

The presentation must meet the following requirements:
- All students in the group must speak, e.g., take in terms covering the different parts.
- On the first appearance, each speaker must identify themselves before presenting. This includes 
showing the speakerâ€™s face on the screen (either full screen or in thumbnail).
- No PowerPoint slides are needed. You are recommended to speak without notes. You may show 
parts of your report on the screen if relevant but should not be reading your report.
- Duration of approximately 5 minutes (about 1 minute for each of the items). The duration must be 
more than 4 minutes and less than 7 minutes.
- The presentation should be submitted as a single file. The file format must be mp4.
