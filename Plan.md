## Communication Strategy

The effective communication strategy is more effctive in teamwork and for delivery in successful project. It make sure that every member in the team remian connected to each other and give details of problem which they faced during project formation and this maximize transparency, reliablity during project lifecycle.


### Communication Tools


- **Instant Messaging (e.g., Teams, Slack)**:It Provide a real time communication for quick updates of project, for real time time clarifications, and removing minor errors. It helps to reduce times, and make the team member connected to each other during working time and promotes collaboration across various locations (Martyushev et al., 2021).

- **Emails**: It is uded for formal communication like progree reports, new announcements, detailed reports and new updates on projects. An emial provide a good written record that ensure important information is to be preserved.


- **Video Conferencing (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet)**: IT help for face to face intraction for daily prgress update, discussions and collaborative communication. It supports brainstorming, it help to clarigy complex topics and make the team aligned with project's objective and tiumelines.

- **Task Management Tools (e.g., Trello, Jira)**: It provide a structured way to oragnize tha taks of the project, it help in assigning work to different team memver in easy ay and help to track progress smoothly. They offers a visual overview on workflow of thw project, dealine and delivery date of the project, and also used as a central hub for storing the project resources and documentation (Gudas et al., 2025).



## Communication Methods

There are following channel of communication will used for discussion during the project:

- **Real-Time Messaging for Immediate Responses**: Instant messaging will be used to quickly communicate, clarify or fix minor problems. This trend is particularly effective if the workforce is divided spatially, further limiting any bottlenecks or inconsistencies between the flow of information.


- **Emails for Structured and Formal Communication**: SO, email serve as the main way to communicate for official updates during project lifecycle, formation of report and when detailed documentation made. An email provide a well written record, and ensure that important information is kept during lifecycle of the project.

- **Weekly Video Calls for Project Alignment**: Weekly video calls provide a well platform for discussing about project progress, talkin about challenges face by group members and planning of tasks for upcomming weeks. This type of meeting ensure that all members remain aligned with project objective, deadline, and decision making. 


- **Asynchronous Reporting**: For live discussions, the group members will write their weekly progress reports and such document decribe their acheivment, most challenging part, and who=at should be done in next week.

### Meeting Framework

The meeting structure include:

- **Weekly Progress Meetings**:

  - **When**: Every Monday at 10:00 AM

  - **Purpose**: This weekly progress meetings gives a team members, to share thier weekly progress report, talk to any challenges fach in the project and plan for task which would be perform in next week. These meeting provide space for feedback if any feedback occur, proble-solving and communication.

  - **Format**: Every member of the team reports their accomplishment , challenges and gaol for the next week and the leader of the project ensures that all issue should be resolve before deadline and the project remians on the track.

- **Stage Evaluations**:

  - **When**: At the end of Weeks 7, 9, and 10

  - **Purpose**: The stage Evaluation meeting occur at the end of week 7,8,9 to evaluate the project conditions that project milestone and thier objective meet and thier progress is on the track or not.At end the result is compared with the plan to see that project fulfill the criteria.

  - **Format**: The detailed reviewed of the project progress with all challenges and also mention if anything will be change to fulfill the objective of the project.

### Reporting Protocol

A well reporting process ensures transparency during the project. The progress of report of the project document, mention challenges and any changes and it always help to track the project:

- **Weekly Updates**: All the team members give a report to the manager on the weekly basis. The report will also include a summary of both work completed and problems/obstacles encountered to date; work is to be completed during the following week; all members of the project are to be informed of work completed to date and/or make necessary arrangements for work encountered during the week as work proceeds.

- **Monthly Milestone Reports**: The reporting will be at the end of any important milestone, i.e. at the end of week 7, 9 and 10 will be prepared a comprehensive report on the project's progress towards the project's objective. The progress report will include the correlation of the activities and potential risks and/or delay that may have affected the project schedule.


- **Final Project Report**: At the end of the project a final report will be written about the entire project that will include a discussion of the overall project, which services were chosen for cloud, which kind of network was used, and lastly the security area. That report will be used in the final evaluation and reviewed by the stakeholders.

### Communication Roles and Responsibilities

All members of the team will need to have roles and these will be responsible for good communication and effective project flow:

- **Project Lead**: If the person who organizes the meeting and attends to make a clear communication is one single person, we take the state of the project from the normals completed by this person. They will have the responsibility for information, management, and coordination between all members of their project team.

- **Team Members**: This is the person that is actually going to go to the meetings and volunteer the progress, and report any problems that will come up. All members will be expected to stay abreast of project activity and to engage in discussion of problems to be solved.



## Project Timeline

### Week 5: Getting Started

 **Tasks**:

 - This includes determining the objectives, identifying resources and deliverables. This review offers a good basis for all subsequent project activities.

 - Have tasks that break down into smaller tasks and can be assigned to others in the team Each member will be accountable and take responsibility for what he/she is expected to do.

 - Thirdly, both conversation mechanism and assistant task mechanism for continuousness, for continuousness generation, each mechanism type will be divided into two types of continuous conversation mechanism and assistant task mechanism - the continuous conversation mechanism and the assistant task mechanism (Slack message service and Trello task assistant service service).


 - At this stage you're focused on ensuring that work in Part I, the network design, gets carried out according to the plan. This means having all the resources and starting to design the preliminary structure of the network backbone


### Week 6: Planning & Research

 **Tasks**:

 - A lesser amount of effort used on network architecture. This will include identification of devices necessary for network typology and interconnection design between parts of the system. All the elements of the proposed infrastructure will be modelled through network schematic representations.


 - In addition, detailed recommendations about wireless network configuration in the office environment will be developed. This would be access-point siting, settings to build strong coverage, and other configuration settings for optimal performance of WPA3.

 - A security management strategy will be created and developed which addresses potential operational of electronic systems risks. Identify system vulnerabilities and detail the protocols and processes that will help reduce the accepted risks.

### Week 7: First Draft & Review

 **Tasks**:

 - A tentative network-design will be drawn up and checked. Stakeholder/team member feedback will be part of the draft, either by referencing it or through developing the work based on input. Corrective action will then be taken based on that feedback and areas for improvement will be highlighted. 


 - Specific applications of cloud-solutions will arise with design efforts that incorporate cloud-storage and even virtual-machine resources into the solution. This integration will eliminate the need to evaluate cloud potential as an augmentation to network performance capacity and scaling.

 - A risk management document creates a foundation focus Risk assessment will be modified, or, new knowledge will be implemented and continuous analysis will be conducted.

### Week 8: Building & Testing

 **Tasks**:

 - The next stage will be through the stipulation of the system of the main units of the network infrastructure i.e. configuration of router, switch, fire-walls etc. where it will be established that these units are functioning as per design to operate as links within the overall network design.
 

 - Testing of cloud service will still be on and it will work on the way it interacts with their physical facility, the predictability in them and their performance. Verifications will guide towards the smoothness of the connections of virtual machines, storage and other supporting cloud services to the hardware in the premises.

 - There will be a review conducted to identify the weaknesses of the various systems. This will consist of security testing, and monitoring of network traffic and possible danger.

### Week 9: Bringing Everything Together

 **Tasks**:

 - BY integrating cloud based services with the main network infrastructure always ensure continuos communiction and flow of data acrss the organization without any objection.

 - BY mentaining a well organized record of the implementation process, like hardware requirement,software requirement and technical decissions and thier alternative process for developing the infrastructure.

 - BY reviewing the progress of the project against the plan or abjective of the project to confirm that project is on the track and it fulfill all criteria. If any delays is occur, then the adjustments of time to make the project on track.



### Week 10: Final Testing & Refinement

 **Tasks**:

 - By conduction a full end to end to testing of the project, like cloud services, security testing of cloud services, and network infrastructure component and to verify overall performence. During this if any problem occurs it should be reolved during this period immediately.

 - At the end finalizing the documment by updating it anf ensure that it should cover all point like network infrastructure, security design and its configuration one by one in serial way and make sure document should be prepare in well manner way so it can be used in future to take refernce to make another one based on that.

 - Designing the ultimate depiction for the stakeholders would commence This will include practicing the significant issues, verifying that all team members are ready to present their portions of the presentation (each section is presented separately) and making sure the presentation is aligned with the final project deliverables.

### Week 11: Wrapping Up

 **Tasks**:


 - Products that have been completed will be ready to be submitted. Project Close at Projected Completion, Level II - This Trunk Hposite would comprise a list of all documentation, reports, and files in the project that define the scope of the design, implementation, and completion accomplishments.

 - Demonstration of the implemented project will be performed for the stakeholder. In this presentation,provide an overview of the network architecture, the cloud integration provided, the security architecture, and the overall value of the solution provided.

 - An assessment of the project will be performed at the end which will reflect on the problems and the successes of the project and the lessons learnt so far. This reflection would be of excellent use in further projects.
